<h2 class="post-title">About me</h2>

{{<small-image image="picture.jpg" float="left" >}}

I am a functional programmer with a strong interest for statically-typed languages and distributed systems.
I believe in proper domain modeling that makes illegal states impossible to represent, thoughtful error management, attention
to performance, and thorough testing.

I've been programming since the age of 13, have tried many different languages (Ruby, Javascript, Clojure, ReasonML, Purescript...) and
have been programming professionally 7 years, including more 4 years of commercial Scala experience.

I enjoy exchanging knowledge with others. I have participated in various conferences and meetups.
