<h2 class="post-title">About me</h2>

{{<small-image image="picture.jpg" float="left" >}}

I am a functional programmer with a strong focus on statically-typed languages and distributed systems.
I specialize in domain modeling that makes illegal states unrepresentable, robust error handling, performance optimization,
and comprehensive testing.<br/>
I've been programming since age 13 as a hobby, and professionally since 2017. 
My experience spans multiple languages (Ruby, JavaScript, Clojure, ReasonML, PureScript, Erlang), including 4 years of commercial Scala development,
and the last 2 years working with Rust.

I enjoy exchanging knowledge with others. I have participated in various conferences and meetups.
