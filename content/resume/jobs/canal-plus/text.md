At Canal+, one of France's leading audiovisual groups, I played a key role in building a next-generation media assets management platform (Mediahub) designed to handle decades of TV shows, sports events, and movies. As the lead developer of the documentation services team, I architected and implemented core systems that helped journalists and archivists interact with millions of videos:

- I led a sophisticated documentation service enabling users to annotate specific moments within videos, capturing detailed metadata about participants, actions, and topics.
- I developed a powerful search infrastructure combining full-text capabilities with faceted navigation, allowing users to find exact moments within vast video archives.
- I architected a concept management system handling evolving metadata while maintaining historical accuracy and searchability.
- I led the migration of legacy content through a high-throughput pipeline that transformed millions of XML documents while preserving historical annotations.

As technical lead, I drove technical excellence and team growth through:
- Mentoring team members in Scala and functional programming, introducing Cats Effect and championing purely functional practices
- Establishing architectural standards through hexagonal architecture and property-based testing
- Streamlining API documentation across microservices by introducing Tapir
- Maintaining code quality through improvement workshops and technical debt management
- Contributing to engineering culture via development conferences and brown-bag sessions

The Mediahub platform leverages reactive and distributed systems principles, built on Scala, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, and the Typelevel ecosystem.
