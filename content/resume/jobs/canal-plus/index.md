description: |
  Canal Plus is a glboal leader of pay-television, movie production and  movie distribution. 

  My team is building Mediahub, a media asset management system (MAM), the cornerstone
  of the group's media supply chain. We are ingesting 300+ hours of new content every day.
  The platform is responsible for transcoding assets as they enter and leave the system, creating proxies, storing
  and retrieving assets from hot and cold storage and more. 

  As a lead Scala developer, I used Kafka and fs2 to develop ETLs that allowed us move massive amounts of data safely from the legacy systems, and
  eventually shut down legacy systems. Now, I'm leading the archiving feature team. My team is providing archivists the tools they need to
  document and retrieve videos from a very large catalog.

  We're working with **Cats, Cats Effect, fs2, Tapir and Akka**. I'm encouraging my team mates to apply functional programming, hexagonal architecture,
  and test everything with property-based tests (**Scalacheck**).
