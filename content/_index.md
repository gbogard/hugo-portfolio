Hi there! Thanks for stopping on my website.

**My name is Guillaume Bogard, I am a functional programmer with an appeal for statically-typed languages
and distributed systems.**

I code mostly in Rust nowadays, but I have a strong commercial Scala experience and am interested in statically-typed languages in general.
My hobbies include writing on my [blog](/posts), [making videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJ2z2ywUUbJaG1uGciI2hg), going to the movies,
riding roller-coasters and making noise on mechanical keyboards that go _click! clack!_.

I work for [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/), and we are building a privacy-first search engine from scratch using Rust. 
Before that, I was a lead developer at [Canal+](https://www.canalplus.com/), and contributed to build the internal video management tools
using Scala.

Here's my [résumé](/jobs) should you need more details.
